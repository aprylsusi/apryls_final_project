**Apryl's Attempt at a Final Project**

**Python judges your favorite things**

This package in Python is designed to give you positive feedback on your favorite animals. Simply call the function "judgy_python" from the "Animals" python notebook and type in the name of your favorite animal within quotations and find out what Python thinks of your choice.

This package incorporates user defined functions, nested if then else statements, the inbuilt type and length functions, as well as return statements. It incorpoarates a check to make sure that a character value is being entered. Code will be tested utilizing pytest to ensure that character values deliver the correct response and that non-character values deliver the response for a request to enter a text value and not the corresponding response that correlates to the length.

Future fixes and add ons for this package would be to correctly identify character/string versions of numbers, add in another argument to be fed into the function, which item you want judged (i.e. color, food, team, etc.), and add in a random aspect to the feedback received.

Guidance for pytest was obtained from https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/
