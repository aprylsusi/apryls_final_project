**Apryl's Attempt at a Final Project**

**Python judges your favorite things**

This package in Python is designed to give you positive feedback on your favorite animals. Simply call the function and type in the name of your favorite animal within quotations and find out what Python thinks of your choice.

This package incorporates user defined functions, nested if then else statements, the inbuilt type and length functions, as well as return statements. It incorpoarates a check to make sure that a character value is being entered.

Future fixes and add ons for this package would be to correctly identify character/string versions of numbers, add in another argument to be fed into the function, which item you want judged (i.e. color, food, team, etc.), and add in a random aspect to the feedback received.
